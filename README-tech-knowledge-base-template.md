# Technical Knowledge Base Generator Template

## Overview

The Technical Knowledge Base Generator Template is designed to create comprehensive, well-structured technical documentation that combines theoretical understanding with practical implementation guidance. This template guides users through a systematic process to research, organize, and document technical topics into authoritative reference materials.

## Template Steps

1. **Define and Scope the Topic**: Break down the technical topic into key components and necessary research areas to establish boundaries and focus.

2. **Research Authoritative Sources**: Gather information from official documentation, GitHub repositories, expert blogs, conference presentations, and community discussions.

3. **Create Introduction**: Develop an overview of the technology, provide historical context, establish current relevance, and identify key use cases.

4. **Define Core Concepts**: Explain fundamental principles, architecture or key components, and clarify technical terminology.

5. **Create Getting Started Guide**: Provide installation and setup instructions, basic configuration, and a minimal working example.

6. **Document Best Practices**: Outline industry-standard approaches, design patterns, performance optimization techniques, and security considerations.

7. **Provide Common Patterns and Examples**: Create practical code samples for common tasks with step-by-step explanations and use case examples.

8. **Add Troubleshooting Section**: Document common errors and solutions, debugging techniques, and approaches to resolving performance problems.

9. **Cover Advanced Topics**: Address scaling considerations, integration with other systems, and advanced features or techniques.

10. **Compile Resources and References**: Gather links to official documentation, recommended learning materials, community resources, and reference implementations.

## Generated Artifact

The template produces a comprehensive technical documentation document:

### technical-knowledge-base.md

A complete technical knowledge base that includes:
- Table of contents for easy navigation
- Introduction with overview, historical context, and use cases
- Core concepts including architecture diagrams and terminology
- Getting started guide with installation and configuration
- Best practices section covering standards and security
- Code examples and common implementation patterns
- Troubleshooting guide with solutions to common problems
- Advanced topics for experienced users
- Curated resources and references

## Using the Template

To use the Technical Knowledge Base Generator Template:

1. Start a session with the template:
   ```typescript
   const result = await templateThinkingTool.processThought({
     templateId: 'tech-knowledge-base-template'
   }, context);
   ```

2. Progress through each step, providing detailed research and content at each stage:
   ```typescript
   const updateResult = await templateThinkingTool.processThought({
     sessionId: result.sessionId,
     stepId: result.activeStep.id,
     content: '...'  // Your research and content for the current step
   }, context);
   ```

3. Retrieve the artifact template when needed:
   ```typescript
   const artifactTemplate = await templateThinkingTool.processThought({
     command: {
       type: 'get-artifact-template',
       templateId: 'tech-knowledge-base-template',
       sessionId: 'technical-knowledge-base.md'
     }
   }, context);
   ```

## Best Practices

- Begin with thorough topic definition and scoping to ensure focused research
- Prioritize authoritative sources: official documentation, well-maintained repositories, and recognized experts
- Balance theoretical understanding with practical implementation guidance
- Use proper markdown formatting with clear hierarchical heading structure
- Include syntax-highlighted code blocks for all examples
- Incorporate diagrams using Mermaid when helpful for understanding concepts
- Use tables to organize comparative information effectively
- Include blockquotes for important notes or warnings
- Cite all external information with source links
- Ensure examples are practical but not full implementations
- Consider both beginner and advanced user needs in the documentation
- Test code examples to verify they work as documented
